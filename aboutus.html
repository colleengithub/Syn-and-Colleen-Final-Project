    <h2> Syndra </h2>
    <h3> Heyo I'm Syndra and I'm a cofunder of of Music Mania. Along with three other talented girls, we created this website as the result of a group project from our time at the Flatiron School. The Meteor Scholarship Program for 2016 has provided us with the opportunity to further our web development skills and I'm really glad to have taken a chance that's resulted in me discovering a new passion.</h3>
    <h2> Colleen </h2>
    <h3> Hi my name is Colleen and I am a cofounder of Music Mania. Together, Syndra, Sidra, Maylee, and I used what we learned during our time here at the Flatiron School to produce this website. It has been very exciting and very fun participating in this program and I am very grateful to have been able to be apart of it.</h3>
    <h2> Sidra </h2>
    <h3> Hi! My name is Sidra and I am one of the content curators on this website. I helped add artists and links to various pages to help complete our final website. I'm so thankful for the opportunities and knowledge I've been given throughout this course.</h3>
    <h2> Maylee </h2>
    <h3> What's good? My name is Maylee, also known as the content curator, and I contributed to this project by editing the pages to look married to the rest of the webpage. I helped Colleen and Syndra with the smallest details. It's been a pleasure and exciting because my work is able to shine through a couple lines of code. </h3>
